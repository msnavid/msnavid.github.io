My current research focuses on evaluating the changes in neural activity and plasticity (adaptation of the nervous system to the environment) following chiropractic care. I am exploring these changes in individuals with stroke, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. This work informs *when*, *where* and *why* changes occur in the brain due to chiropractic manipulation.

My other main research agenda uses advanced methods to develop (, optimize) and test the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for stroke rehabilitation. This BCI uses EEG to detect *intentions of movement*. When a person intends to move, the BCI assists with the movement of the (affected/paretic) limb using a robot or a small electric pulse. The BCI's efficacy is evaluated from multiple parameters, including changes in neural plasticity using transcranial-magnetic stimulation (TMS).
