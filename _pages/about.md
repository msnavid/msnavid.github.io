Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Centre for Chiropractic Research](http://research.chiropractic.ac.nz/){:target="_blank"} at [New Zealand College of Chiropractic](http://chiropractic.ac.nz/){:target="_blank"}. I earned my Ph.D. in Clinical Science and Biomedicine from [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk/){:target="_blank"}, M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"}, and B.S. in Computer Engineering from [National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences](http://lhr.nu.edu.pk/){:target="_blank"}.

My [research](research) explores the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation on brain activity, primarily using [EEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography){:target="_blank"}. I am also working on the development and evaluation of [BCIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface){:target="_blank"} for stroke rehabilitation.
