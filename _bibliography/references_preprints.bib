	abstract = {Background The contextual interference effect suggests that the random practice of multiple-tasks is more beneficial for the retention and transfer of the learning as compared to blocked practice. Therefore, the transfer of learning is usually attributed to the contextual interference effect and is studied in a multi-task setting.Objective The goals of this study were to evaluate whether the transfer of learning (i) can occur when a single bimanual task is practiced, (ii) is affected by the knowledge of results (feedback), and (iii) sustains over an extended number of trials.Methods Fifty-two healthy subjects were equally divided into four groups. Before the transfer test, two groups practiced a bimanual finger-tapping task with feedback (EF) and without feedback (ENF). The third group (IM) practiced the same task using the kinesthetic motor imagery, whereas the last group acted as a control (CTRL) and performed only a bimanual button-pressing task used for the transfer test.Results Linear mixed-model showed that in the transfer test, groups EF, ENF and IM had similar performance but significantly higher scores compared to the CTRL group. Compared to the CTRL, the EF and IM groups showed significantly improved performance in most of the sessions but group ENF had similar results.Conclusion This study suggests that the single-task practice of a discrete bimanual task can facilitate the learning transfer to a novel task and knowledge of results (feedback) have no significant impact on the transfer of learning. Moreover, the transfer of learning effect does not disappear in extended trials.HighlightsSingle-task practice of a discrete bimanual task can facilitate the learning of a novel bimanual taskKnowledge of results (feedback) does not improve learning transfer in single-task settingTransfer of learning effect does not disappear in extended trials},

	abstract = {Introduction Efficient training methods are required for laparoscopic surgical skills training to reduce the time needed for proficiency. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely used to enhance motor skill acquisition and can be used to supplement the training of laparoscopic surgical skill acquisition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on the performance of a unimanual variant of the laparoscopic peg-transfer task.Methods Fifteen healthy subjects participated in this randomized, double-blinded crossover study involving an anodal tDCS and a sham tDCS intervention separated by 48 hours. On each intervention day, subjects performed a unimanual variant of laparoscopic peg-transfer task in three sessions (baseline, tDCS, post-tDCS). The tDCS session consisted of 10 minutes of offline tDCS followed by 10 minutes of online tDCS. The scores based on the task completion time and the number of errors in each session were used as a primary outcome measure. A linear mixed-effects model was used for the analysis.Results We found that the scores increased over sessions (p\&lt;0.001). However, we found no effects of stimulation (anodal tDCS vs. sham tDCS) and no interaction of stimulation and sessions.Conclusion This study suggests that irrespective of the type of current stimulation (anodal and sham) over M1, there was an improvement in the performance of the unimanual peg-transfer task, implying that there was motor learning over time. The results would be useful in designing efficient training paradigms and further investigating the effects of tDCS on laparoscopic peg-transfer tasks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Recently it has been acknowledged that the basal ganglia nuclei play a major role in cognitive control; however, the contribution by their network remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in cognitive processing and suggested that its connections to cortical and other associated regions regulate response inhibition during conflict conditions. By contrast, the role of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) as the output nucleus before the thalamic relay has not yet been investigated during cognitive processing. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from externalized deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted bilaterally in the GPi (n=9 participants with dystonia) and STN (n=8 participants with Parkinson{\textquoteright}s disease (PD)) during a primed flanker task. Both dystonia (GPi group) and PD participants (STN group) responded faster to the congruent trials than the incongruent trials. Overall, the dystonic GPi group was significantly faster than the PD STN group. LFPs showed elevated cue-triggered theta (3-7 Hz) power in GPi and STN groups in a similar way. Response-triggered LFP beta power (13-25 Hz) was significantly increased in the GPi group compared to the STN group. Results demonstrate that GPi activity appears to be critical in the cognitive processing of action selection and response during the presence of conflict tasks similar to the STN group. As both GPi and STN nuclei are involved in cognitive processing; therefore, these nuclei may be targeted for neuromodulation to improve cognitive control via DBS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialN/AFunding StatementNo external funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The local ethics committee of the University Hospital Munich approved the study.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
