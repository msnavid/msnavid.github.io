	abstract = {Background The contextual interference effect suggests that the random practice of multiple-tasks is more beneficial for the retention and transfer of the learning as compared to blocked practice. Therefore, the transfer of learning is usually attributed to the contextual interference effect and is studied in a multi-task setting.Objective The goals of this study were to evaluate whether the transfer of learning (i) can occur when a single bimanual task is practiced, (ii) is affected by the knowledge of results (feedback), and (iii) sustains over an extended number of trials.Methods Fifty-two healthy subjects were equally divided into four groups. Before the transfer test, two groups practiced a bimanual finger-tapping task with feedback (EF) and without feedback (ENF). The third group (IM) practiced the same task using the kinesthetic motor imagery, whereas the last group acted as a control (CTRL) and performed only a bimanual button-pressing task used for the transfer test.Results Linear mixed-model showed that in the transfer test, groups EF, ENF and IM had similar performance but significantly higher scores compared to the CTRL group. Compared to the CTRL, the EF and IM groups showed significantly improved performance in most of the sessions but group ENF had similar results.Conclusion This study suggests that the single-task practice of a discrete bimanual task can facilitate the learning transfer to a novel task and knowledge of results (feedback) have no significant impact on the transfer of learning. Moreover, the transfer of learning effect does not disappear in extended trials.HighlightsSingle-task practice of a discrete bimanual task can facilitate the learning of a novel bimanual taskKnowledge of results (feedback) does not improve learning transfer in single-task settingTransfer of learning effect does not disappear in extended trials},

	abstract = {Introduction Efficient training methods are required for laparoscopic surgical skills training to reduce the time needed for proficiency. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely used to enhance motor skill acquisition and can be used to supplement the training of laparoscopic surgical skill acquisition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1) on the performance of a unimanual variant of the laparoscopic peg-transfer task.Methods Fifteen healthy subjects participated in this randomized, double-blinded crossover study involving an anodal tDCS and a sham tDCS intervention separated by 48 hours. On each intervention day, subjects performed a unimanual variant of laparoscopic peg-transfer task in three sessions (baseline, tDCS, post-tDCS). The tDCS session consisted of 10 minutes of offline tDCS followed by 10 minutes of online tDCS. The scores based on the task completion time and the number of errors in each session were used as a primary outcome measure. A linear mixed-effects model was used for the analysis.Results We found that the scores increased over sessions (p\&lt;0.001). However, we found no effects of stimulation (anodal tDCS vs. sham tDCS) and no interaction of stimulation and sessions.Conclusion This study suggests that irrespective of the type of current stimulation (anodal and sham) over M1, there was an improvement in the performance of the unimanual peg-transfer task, implying that there was motor learning over time. The results would be useful in designing efficient training paradigms and further investigating the effects of tDCS on laparoscopic peg-transfer tasks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
