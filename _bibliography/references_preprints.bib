	abstract = {Background The contextual interference effect suggests that the random practice of multiple-tasks is more beneficial for the retention and transfer of the learning as compared to blocked practice. Therefore, the transfer of learning is usually attributed to the contextual interference effect and is studied in a multi-task setting.Objective The goals of this study were to evaluate whether the transfer of learning (i) can occur when a single bimanual task is practiced, (ii) is affected by the knowledge of results (feedback), and (iii) sustains over an extended number of trials.Methods Fifty-two healthy subjects were equally divided into four groups. Before the transfer test, two groups practiced a bimanual finger-tapping task with feedback (EF) and without feedback (ENF). The third group (IM) practiced the same task using the kinesthetic motor imagery, whereas the last group acted as a control (CTRL) and performed only a bimanual button-pressing task used for the transfer test.Results Linear mixed-model showed that in the transfer test, groups EF, ENF and IM had similar performance but significantly higher scores compared to the CTRL group. Compared to the CTRL, the EF and IM groups showed significantly improved performance in most of the sessions but group ENF had similar results.Conclusion This study suggests that the single-task practice of a discrete bimanual task can facilitate the learning transfer to a novel task and knowledge of results (feedback) have no significant impact on the transfer of learning. Moreover, the transfer of learning effect does not disappear in extended trials.HighlightsSingle-task practice of a discrete bimanual task can facilitate the learning of a novel bimanual taskKnowledge of results (feedback) does not improve learning transfer in single-task settingTransfer of learning effect does not disappear in extended trials},
